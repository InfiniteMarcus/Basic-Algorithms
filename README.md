## Basic Algorithms

[ðŸ‘‰ Portuguese]()

### Purpose

The purpose of this repository is stored some algorithms that I wrote for programming languages that I use daily.

You can find a directory for each language. Each file in a directory represents and algorithm or function.

This is a non-stop working in progress, so more algorithms and languages will be available over time.

### Programming Languages
