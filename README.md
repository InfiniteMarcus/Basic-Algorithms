## Basic Algorithms

Choose a README language:
- ðŸ‘‰ **English**
- [Portuguese](https://github.com/InfiniteMarcus/Basic-Algorithms/blob/main/README_pt-br.md)

### Purpose

The purpose of this repository is stored some algorithms that I wrote for programming languages that I use daily.

You can find a directory for each language. Each file in a directory represents and algorithm or function.

This is a non-stop working in progress, so more algorithms and languages will be available over time.

### Programming Languages

- [C](https://github.com/InfiniteMarcus/Basic-Algorithms/tree/main/c)
- [C++](https://github.com/InfiniteMarcus/Basic-Algorithms/tree/main/c%2B%2B)
- [JavaScript](https://github.com/InfiniteMarcus/Basic-Algorithms/tree/main/javascript)
